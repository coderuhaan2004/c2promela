Convert the following C code to Promela, preserving its functionality and logic. 
Use appropriate Promela constructs, such as `proctype`, `do`, `if`, `goto`, `chan`, or `atomic` where applicable. 
Ensure variable declarations, loops, and conditionals are properly translated.

C Code:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int year;

    // Input year from the user
    printf("Enter a year: ");
    scanf("%d", &year);

    // Check if the year is leap year
    if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
        printf("%d is a leap year.
", year);
    } else {
        printf("%d is not a leap year.
", year);
    }

    return 0;
}


Promela Equivalent:

#define LEAP_YEAR(Y) \
    ((Y % 4 == 0 && Y % 100 != 0) || (Y % 400 == 0))

proctype main() {
    int year;

    printf("Enter a year: ");
    scanf("%d", &year);

    if (LEAP_YEAR(year)) {
        printf("%d is a leap year.
", year);
    } else {
        printf("%d is not a leap year.
", year);
    }

    return 0;
}
